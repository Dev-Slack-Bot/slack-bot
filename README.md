In a 5 day sprint our team brainstormed, planned, and delivered a mobile friendly Brewlette app. Working remotely, the team utilized multiple tools to stay connected and openly communicate on project plans. Our team utilized highly practiced and desired frameworks, libraries, etc. to create an easy fun app that randomly finds you a place to drink. 

# DESCRIPTION

You can ask the bot to take a look at all your favorites later or delete it if you're done with it! Slack-Cat was built for enjoymeny, hop in a say 'Hello' to our bot!
